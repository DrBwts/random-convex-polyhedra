# random-convex-polyhedra
Generates random convex polyhedra
n_vert: number of vertices
aspect_ratio: threshold value for ratio of the incribed circle to the outscribed circle of any face on the polyhedra. If any face has a value below the threshold the polyhedra is discarded.
facet_col: color of the polyhedra

All vertices are within the unit cube.
